    "---\n",
    "reading files, creating files, writing to files, appending to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To read files in Python, you need to use the `open()` function to open a file object and then use the `read()`, `readline()` or `readlines()` methods to read its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes of `open` file object\n",
    "The modes of the `open()` function specify how the file will be opened and what operations can be performed on it. The modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`‘r’`**: Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.\n",
    "* **`‘r+’`**: Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "* **`‘w’`**: Opens a file for writing only. `Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.`\n",
    "* **`‘w+’`**: Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.\n",
    "* **`‘a’`**: Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "* **`‘a+’`**: Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.</br>\n",
    "You can also add a `‘b’` to any of these modes to open the file in **binary mode**, which means that the data is read and written as bytes objects. This is useful for non-text files such as **images or audio files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# open a file in read mode\n",
    "file = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# read the whole file and returns all the content as a single string\n",
    "print(file.read()) \n",
    "\n",
    "# close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `with` keyword to automatically close the file after reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# use with keyword to open and close a file\n",
    "with open(\"test.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # read the whole file and returns all the content as a single string\n",
    "    print(file.read())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in methods of `open` file object\n",
    "* **`read(size)`**: It reads up to size bytes from the file and returns a string. If size is omitted or negative, it reads until the end of the file.\n",
    "* **`readline(size)`**: It reads one line from the file and returns a string. If size is given, it reads at most size bytes from the line. An empty string is returned when the end of the file is reached.\n",
    "* **`readlines(sizehint)`**: It reads all the lines from the file and returns a list of strings. If sizehint is given, it reads approximately sizehint bytes from the file and splits them into lines.\n",
    "* **`write(string)`**: It writes the string to the file and returns None. It does not add a newline character at the end of the string.\n",
    "* **`writelines(lines)`**: It writes a list of strings to the file and returns None. It does not add newline characters at the end of each string.\n",
    "* **`close()`**: It closes the file and frees up any system resources used by it. It is recommended to use this method after finishing any file operations.\n",
    "* **`flush()`**: It forces any buffered data to be written to the file. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the data is written immediately without waiting for buffering.\n",
    "* **`seek(offset, whence)`**: It changes the cursor location in the file or the current file position to offset bytes, relative to whence. The whence argument can be 0 (start of the file), 1 (current position), or 2 (end of the file). It returns the new file position in bytes. The `seek()` method of the file object allows you to change the current position of the file pointer within the file. The file pointer is like a cursor that indicates where the next read or write operation will take place. The `seek()` method takes two parameters:\n",
    "    * `offset:` This is a number of bytes to move the file pointer from the reference point. It can be positive (move forward) or negative (move backward).\n",
    "    * `whence:` This is an optional parameter that specifies the reference point from which to move the file pointer. It can be one of the following values:\n",
    "        * `0`: The beginning of the file (default)\n",
    "        * `1`: The current position of the file pointer\n",
    "        * `2`: The end of the file</br>\n",
    "The `seek()` method returns None and does not raise any exception if the operation is successful. However, it may raise an OSError if the file is not opened in binary mode and whence is not 0 or offset is not 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# open the file in read mode\n",
    "f = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# move the file pointer to the 6th byte from the beginning\n",
    "f.seek(6)\n",
    "# read 5 bytes from that position\n",
    "print(f.read(5)) # output: world\n",
    "\n",
    "# move the file pointer to the 3rd byte from the end\n",
    "f.seek(-3, 2)\n",
    "# read 3 bytes from that position\n",
    "print(f.read(3)) # output: ile\n",
    "\n",
    "# move the file pointer to the 8th byte from the current position\n",
    "f.seek(8, 1)\n",
    "# read one line from that position\n",
    "print(f.readline()) # output: This is a test file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# close the file\n",
    "f.close()\n",

    "---\n",
    "**`map()`** and **`filter()`** are built-in functions in Python that are used to solve many complex problems easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`map()`** is used when we want to apply the same function repeatedly on a different set of elements. It is beneficial in solving mathematical problems where we apply the same formula to a different set of values.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(func, *iterables) --> map object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`filter()`** is used when we want to exclude the elements from the given `list, tuple, or set`. This type of function is mainly used in problems based on `sorting techniques`. We can sort the elements quickly based on the condition using this filter() function.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter(function or None, iterable) --> filter object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `map()` and `filter()` functions are higher-order functions in Python. A higher-order function is referred to a function whose attributes or parameters are in the form of a function, and it returns output in the form of a function only. These higher-order functions in Python help to solve mathematical and complex analytical problems quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed explanation and working of both functions with examples are given below. Both map() and filter() functions are built-in and higher-order functions, but their working is different. The area of application of both functions is different because of their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the functionality of both functions, first, we should know the difference between them. Let’s understand the difference between them in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`map()`** function always passes all the **elements/iterables** through the **transform function**. The result is printed in the form of a map object for the map() function. We can convert those map objects into a list. The mapping technique is implemented in the map() function. Transform function can take N number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`filter()`** function always checks the condition in terms of Boolean values and then passes elements through the function. The result is printed in the form of a filter object, and those filter objects can be converted into a list. The function used for checking conditions in the filter function must take only one argument."
